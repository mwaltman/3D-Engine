The engine displays the map for which the coordinates are given in 'Level 1.txt'. The first line denotes *max x grid position*, *max y grid position* and *max floor/ceiling height*. All subsequent lines will denote a 'tile' and is stored as *x grid position*, *y grid position*, *floor height* and *ceiling height*.

**Controls:**
- Use W to move forwards, S to move backwards and A and D to strafe left and right.
- Use the mouse to move the camera.
- Use Spacebar to jump.
- Use Ctrl to crouch.
- Use F to toggle between flying and walking.
- Use R to toggle between displaying and hiding the red line that shows your previous positions.
